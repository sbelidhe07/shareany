# ShareAny (CodeNBuild 2020 idea submission)

Food waste is an ecological, economic, and social problem. Food wastage appears to be highest in developed countries, while on the other hand, there are an estimated 842 million people in poor countries experiencing chronic hunger. This raises the question as to whether food wastage could be reduced along food supply chains. Despite the significance of this issue to the global foodservice industry, the link between innovation practices and food waste management has received limited attention. Food providers in gastronomy, catering, and hospitality have recently come under increasing scrutiny over their food management practices, and specifically food waste, with evidence that considerable amounts of food are thrown away during preparation, or because they cannot be stored and reused. There might be a lot of applications addressing this issue but our application is unique as we are incorporating the below-mentioned scenarios along with addressing food wastage People have old books, articles, magazines, electronic goods which they do not use and keep aside just like that long time. These things can be shared with other people who are ready/interested to use them People have a huge stock of medicine which they ordered or bought by mistake and donâ€™t know what to do. They can share it with the other people who are in need of those medicines Companies have a lot of old electronic good, magazines or other stuff which can be shared with other people who can use it
